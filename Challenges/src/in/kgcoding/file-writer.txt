Hello, welcome to FileWriter Documentation:

FileWriter is a Java class from java.io package used to write character data to files.

It writes text (not binary) â€” useful for .txt, .csv, .log, etc.

Syntax: FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("file.txt");

Use write() method to write strings or characters.

By default, it overwrites existing file content.

To append, use: new FileWriter("file.txt", true);

Always call close() to release file resources.

Optionally use flush() to force write buffered data.

Must handle or declare IOException.

Often combined with BufferedWriter for efficiency.
